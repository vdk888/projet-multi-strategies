Before each step, read @implementation-plan - progress.md to see what has been implemented and what remains to be done, to ensure consistency.
At each step, start by asking the user to clarify all the details of the current mission, services to be used, preferences, etc. Do not start coding before user's approval.
After each step, update @implementation-plan - progress.md to add any new features implemented, methods used, inputs and outputs.
